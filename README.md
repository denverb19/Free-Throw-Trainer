11/19/20 - Added buttons for controlling initial velocity and distance to backboard and reworked transformation matrices to make the new buttons work. Scaled all dimensions to realistic proportions using a scale of 1 in world unit = 1 meter. Keep in mind that the cubes have a length of 2 by default and the spheres have diameter of 2 by default in order to understand the scaling formulae. Note that the radius of a basketball is 23.4 cm and the hoop is 3.05 meters off the ground which in our case is at y=-1.


11/16/20 - Basketball now follows correct trajectory and behavior. Created adjustable buttons for vertical and horizontal angles and they are all working fine, I have it running on a four second loop right now for testing purposes but we will fix that later of course. Overall good progress.
